Configure Google Tag Manager to track events when a user purchases your product or service.

To track sales conversion events with Google Tag Manager, you'll need to set up a server container and configure a custom client to handle Dub conversion events.

## Step 1: Set up Server Container

In Google Tag Manager, you'll need to use an existing server container or create a new one. Server containers are the foundation for server-side tracking and allow you to process events before they reach their final destinations.

- If you already have a server container set up, you can use that
- If not, create a new server container in your GTM workspace

## Step 2: Import Dub GTM Server Client Template

> If you've already set up the Dub GTM Server Client for lead tracking, you can skip step #2, #3 and #4

Add a new Client Template using the import option:

1. In your server container, go to **Client Templates** → **New**
2. Click **Import** and upload the [Dub GTM Server Client template](https://github.com/dubinc/gtm-server-client-template)

## Step 3: Create Dub Server Client

Next, create a new Client using the imported template:

1. In your server container, go to **Clients** → **New**
2. Select the **Dub GTM Server Client** template from **Custom**
3. Name the client "Dub Server Client" (or any descriptive name)
4. Set the **Request Path** to `/dub/track`
5. Optionally enable debug logging for troubleshooting

> Clients in GTM Server are adapters that act as bridges between the software running on a user's device and your server container. They receive requests and transform them into events that can be processed by tags.

## Step 4: Import Dub GTM Server Tag Template

Next, import the Dub GTM Server Tag template to handle sales tracking:

1. In your server container, go to **Tags** → **New**
2. Click **Import** and upload the [Dub GTM Server Tag template](https://github.com/dubinc/gtm-server-tag-template)
3. This template is specifically designed to send conversion events directly to Dub

## Step 5: Add Sales Tracking Tag

Next, create a new tag for sales tracking with proper mapping:

1. In your server container, go to **Tags** → **New**
2. Select the **Dub Conversion Tag** template from **Custom**
3. Name the tag "Dub Sales Tracking" (or any descriptive name)
4. Configure the tag settings:

- **Dub API Key**: Enter your [Dub API key](https://dub.co/docs/api-reference/tokens) (starts with `dub_`)
- **Event**: Select "Track sale"
- **Customer External ID**: Map to the `customerExternalId` from the event data
- **Amount**: Map to the `amount` from the event data (in cents)
- **Currency**: Map to the `currency` from the event data (e.g., "usd")
- **Event Name**: Map to the `eventName` from the event data (e.g., "Purchase")
- **Payment Processor**: Map to the `paymentProcessor` from the event data (e.g., "stripe")
- **Invoice ID**: Map to the `invoiceId` from the event data (optional)
- **Lead Event Name**: Map to the `leadEventName` from the event data (optional)
- **Metadata**: Map to the `metadata` from the event data (optional)

5. **Triggering**: Configure when the tag should fire:

- Click **Triggering** in the tag configuration
- Click **+** to add a new trigger
- Select **Custom Event** as the trigger type
- Set the **Event Name** to match the event name from the Dub Server Client. Default is `dub_conversion`
- Add a condition to filter for sales events:
  - **Variable**: Select a variable that contains the event type
  - **Operator**: Equals
  - **Value**: "Purchase"
- Name the trigger "Dub Sales Event Trigger" and save it
